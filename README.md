signal-tui relies on this https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli

and ncurses, which can be installed on ubuntu/debian with this: 

	 sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

Warning: it appears that when you message someone from this, you lose the ability to message that person from the phone number you used. Use at own risk. Hopefully this is a bug and can be fixed in the future.
